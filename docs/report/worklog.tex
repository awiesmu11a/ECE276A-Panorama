\subsection*{To verify}

Check fluctuation in VICON plots from $[\pi, -\pi]$.
Check bias calculation
The shape of orientation curve obtained from motion model matches very minutely;
Current problem is estimated as scaling factor;
If scaling factor for omega is higher the trajectory would match to desired level
